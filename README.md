Final Capstone Project:

To understand the project functionality, follow along in the power point.
There are provided demo slides that will step through the process of working
with the GUI and logger together. 

Provided Code:

1) Keylogger. Can open as a script to automatically run on the command line.
Or you can open in an IDE and run as a python project. Remember, when using 
press esc to stop logging information.

2) GUI. Can open this in any IDE and run as a java program. Before using 
logged data from the key logger, you will have to change the directory of where 
this is reading txt files. In the "Controller" File you can see that I read files
from desktop folder called "CapstoneData" for demoing purposes. You can change the
directory to where you end up saving the python logger program and read files directly
from there or create a separate folder for both programs to write and read to and from.
You may have to check you PC permissions before doing this.
